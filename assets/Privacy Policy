1. Introduction
This Privacy Policy describes how this app (“the App”) processes data.
The App itself does not collect or store any personal information, but it uses Google Mobile Ads (AdMob/AdSense), which may process certain data for advertising purposes.

By using the App, you agree to the terms described here.


2. Data Collected by the App
The App does not collect, store, transmit, or share any personal data.
All features operate entirely on the device.

However, third-party services may collect data as described below.


3. Third-Party Advertising (Google AdMob / AdSense)
The App uses Google Mobile Ads to display ads. Google may automatically collect and process the following types of data:
Device identifiers (e.g., AAID – Android Advertising ID)
Approximate location (non-GPS)
App interactions
Crash logs and diagnostics
Ad engagement information
IP address (used temporarily; typically anonymized)

Google uses this information to:
Serve ads
Prevent fraud
Cap ad frequency
Measure performance
Provide personalized ads (if consented)

To learn more, visit Google’s Privacy Policy:

4. Consent (GDPR / UMP SDK)
For users in GDPR-affected regions (e.g., EU, EEA, UK), the App uses Google’s User Messaging Platform (UMP) to request consent before showing personalized ads.

Users may choose:
Personalized ads
Non-personalized ads

To withdraw or change consent at any time via the App’s privacy options Ads will respect your consent choices.


5. CCPA (California Privacy Rights)
California residents can:
Request to opt out of “sale of personal information” (AdMob interprets personalized ads as “sale”)
Request non-personalized ads

The App honors these signals through Google’s privacy handling.


6. Children’s Privacy

This App is not directed to children under 13.
No child-directed ad services are used.


7. Data Security

The App does not collect or store any personal data.
Advertising data is secured and processed by Google in accordance with their industry-standard practices.


8. Changes to This Privacy Policy

This Policy may be updated periodically.
The “Last Updated” date will reflect changes.
